# Color Match
My goal is to create a color match app that allows users to input a color and find coordinating colors for their project.  For this project, I will be limiting the colors to the papers produced by one company.  

## User Stories
* As a visitor, I want to input a specific color and have it return 1-3 cooridinating colors so that I can plan my project.
* As a visitor, I want to input a specific patterned paper and have returned 1-3 coordinating colors so that I can plan my project.
* As an administrator, I want to be able to easily update the program when new colors or patterns are released and/or removed.

### Process
Items to create: 
* Database for colors and patterned papers
* A way to establish which colors/patterns coordinate and store that information 
* User entry to choose color/pattern and pick how many items to return
* Random return of colors already established to be coordinating based on color chosen and number of items to return
* Visual display of selected color/pattern and returned coordinating colors
* A way to pick a different set of coordinating colors, refresh
* A way to reset to input a new initial color
* A pretty interface that works for both desktop and mobile devices
* A way for users to share color themes via social media or save feature
